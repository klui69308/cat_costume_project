  Overall:
  - Fantastic tabbing, it's very easy to read your code!
  - Good design sense regarding setting max-width of site (but it might be against the vision of the designer)

          About Kat
        </h2>
        <p>
          Kat is the ultimate cat lady you've always dreamed you could
          be. Never has a Halloween gone by where her twelve cats weren't
          all dressed to impress. Five years ago, she decided to open
          Kat's Costume Shop to share her passion with the world.
